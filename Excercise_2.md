# Title: Image Compositing Ethics
## Assignment #2

&copy; Bryce DeAlessio, 2017

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our book, [Pocket Book of Technical Writing for Engineers & Scientists (McGraw-Hill's Best: Basic Engineering Series and Tools) 3rd Edition]() a situation is proposed about a couple who take a number of photographs of
themselves nearby a lava flow. They then compose a single image out of three
separate images in order to make it appear as though they ventured further onto
a more dangerous portion of the lava-flow. Their stated motive for creating the
composed photograph is to impress their friends. The question is then posed whether
their actions were ethical? (chapter 7, pg 247) No . Is it breaking a law, no
so long as impressing your friends is the only outcome and the photograph is
not used for any purpose beyond that.
