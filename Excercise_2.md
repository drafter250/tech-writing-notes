&copy; Bryce DeAlessio, 2017

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our book, [Pocket Book of Technical Writing for Engineers & Scientists (McGraw-Hill's Best: Basic Engineering Series and Tools) 3rd Edition]() A situation is proposed about a married couple motivated by the desire to impress friends take a number of photographs nearby a lava flow. They then compose a single image out of three separate images in order to make it appear as though they ventured further onto a more dangerous portion of the lava-flow. The question is then posed Whether their actions were ethical? Yes It is. Is it breaking a law, no so long as impressing your friends is the only outcome and the photograph is not used for any purpose beyond that.
