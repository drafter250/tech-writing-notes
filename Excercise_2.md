&copy; Bryce DeAlessio, 2017

In our book, __Pocket Book of Technical Writing for Engineers & Scientists (McGraw-Hill's Best: Basic Engineering Series and Tools) 3rd Edition__ A situation is proposed about a married couple whom take a number of photographs nearby a lava flow. They then compose a single image out of three separate images in order to make it apear as though they ventured further onto a more dangerous portion of the lava-flow. The question is then posed Whether it is un-ethical to compose an image of a false situatation for the sake of impressing your friends? Yes It is. Is it breaking a law, no so long as impressing your friends is the only outcome and the photograph is not used for any purpose beyond that.
