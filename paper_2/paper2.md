# Process Description

## SCRUM – Applying the Framework

By: DeAlessio, Bryce T. (Student)


 
## Introduction
1) Define the process with a technical definition:

Within the scope of Project Management of software products, Scrum is a “framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value” (Schwaber & Sutherland). This framework sets forth a set of roles for the people involved in a software development project, a series of events that occur during the process and the artifacts that flow through those events to produce a potentially deliverable portion of the overall project. It uses a number of concepts borrowed from “Lean Manufacturing Principles” <need reference (Toyota way)>.

2) Describe the purpose and function of the process:

The purpose of Scrum is to provide a project management process that can handle incomplete and or rapidly changing customer requirements. Scrum is one of a number of project management systems geared toward software and systems development that arose (Beck & others, 2001) due to backlash against the traditional “Water Fall” method. The "Water-Fall Method" placed heavy emphasis on knowing all customer requirements before starting a project and delivering a product to a fixed contract. See figure 1.

Figure 1 (Royce)

In contrast Scrum's emphasis is on maintating close communication with the customer to handle changing requirements.

Scrum Project Process
The Scrum Process is a continuous loop of processes which ends only after the product is deemed done. 
Steps:


    1) Product Owner – the Product Owner is the interface between the customer and the development team
    2) Scrum Manager
    3) Development Team
2) Gather Initial Customer Requirements.
    1) The Product Owner interfaces with the customer requirements for delivering a finished product as well as priority of which functions of the product they would like to see first.
3) The Sprint:
4) Create Product Backlog.
    1) The Product Backlog is the list of features to add to the product that will satisfy the customer’s requirements.
5) The Sprint backlog
    1) For each sprint the scrum team decides which Product Backlog Items to work on.
6) Sprint Planning.
7) The Sprint.
8) Sprint Review.
9) 
9)	Deliver

Why Is It Called Scrum?
When Jeff Sutherland created the scrum process in 1993, he borrowed the term "scrum" from an analogy put forth in a 1986 study by Takeuchi and Nonaka, published in the Harvard Business Review.
